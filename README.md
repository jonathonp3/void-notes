# Void Notes

**Personal guides, tips, and documentation for Void Linux users**

Welcome to **Void Notes** — a collection of my personal guides, tips, configurations, and troubleshooting notes related to using Void Linux.

Void Linux is a general purpose operating system based on the monolithic Linux kernel. Its efficient package system allows quick installation, updating, and removal of software, provided as binary packages or buildable from source via XBPS.

This repository complements the official Void Linux resources by providing practical how-tos, setup guides, and troubleshooting focused on real-world usage, including Raspberry Pi-specific instructions like btrfs setup.
